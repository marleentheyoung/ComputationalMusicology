The corpus I have created consists of 3084 hip hop tracks from various periods in time. The following subgenres are represented in this corpus:
- Old school hip hop
- Turntablism
- Dirty South Rap
- West Coast Rap
- East Coast Rap
- Hardcore Hip Hop
- Glitch Hop
- Miami Bass
- Jazz Rap
- Trap music
- Concious Hip Hop

I would like to analyze how hip hop has changed over time. Up till now, I have noticed that both energy and danceability was significantly higher in old school rap compared to modern rap and trap music. The list of old school tracks has a mean of 106 BPM tempo, whereas newer subgenres result in an average of 117 BPM. Furthermore, danceability is 12% higher for old school (90's) hip hop compared to the newer trap and glitch hop. 

New school hip hop contains three times as much instrumentalism as old school hip hop. I had already expected this since the 'wordsmith'/MC was the pionier of hip hop and the rhymes were definitely most important in early hip hop. 

Although modern hip hop is usually faster than old school hip hop, there are some very slow outliers. The minimum in tempo is 50 BPM for new school hip hop, where the minimum for old school hip hop is 80 BPM.
